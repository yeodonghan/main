== Introduction
Seller Manager Lite (SML) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their sales*. More importantly, SML is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SML can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `sellermanagerlite.jar` https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T09-4/main/releasesreleases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Seller Manager Lite.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

* *`list -c`* : lists all customer contacts
* **`add -c`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a customer named `John Doe` to SML.
